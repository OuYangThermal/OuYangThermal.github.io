<div class="quick"><strong>Quick answer</strong><p>Upgrade conductivity only when the interface is material to the system thermal budget.</p></div>

## Key takeaways

<div class="takeaways">

- Define the installed geometry, heat path, and acceptance limit before selecting a material.
- Compare values only when test methods and conditions are aligned.
- Validate thermal, mechanical, electrical, process, and lifetime behavior in representative hardware.

</div>

## Technical explanation

Methods can differ, and higher filler loading can change density, stiffness, handling, and cost.

Thermal conductivity describes heat transport through material. The installed interface also includes geometry and contact resistance. For a simplified uniform layer, bulk resistance follows R = t/(kA), where t is thickness, k conductivity, and A area. Real assemblies require additional terms and measured validation.

## Selection parameters


| Parameter | Engineering question | Evidence to request |
|---|---|---|
| Conductivity | Which method, direction, and temperature? | Standard and specimen conditions |
| Thermal impedance | At what BLT and pressure? | Data at application conditions |
| Thickness / gap | What is the tolerance range? | Installed measurement |
| Mechanical response | What load reaches the hardware? | Compression-deflection or modulus data |
| Electrical behavior | Is isolation required? | Method, thickness, and aging context |
| Process | How is placement or dispensing controlled? | Work instruction and acceptance criteria |


Also record temperature range, surface finish, vibration or power cycling, material compatibility, inspection, rework, storage, lot control, and any applicable regulatory requirement. A supplier typical value is not a universal guarantee.

## Application example

Test candidates at equal installed thickness and production clamp conditions.

This is an engineering illustration, not a claimed customer case. Final limits depend on the design, material formulation, and stated test conditions.

## Common mistakes

Ranking only by W/m·K; mixing data from different methods; ignoring tolerance and pressure; treating a typical value as a guaranteed design limit; skipping application-level aging.

## FAQ

<details><summary>Is conductivity enough for selection?</summary><p>No. Installed thickness, contact, pressure, geometry, electrical needs, processing, and aging must be evaluated.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can two datasheets be compared directly?</summary><p>Only when methods, units, specimen conditions, and definitions align. Otherwise use controlled side-by-side testing.</p></details>
<details><summary>What belongs in final validation?</summary><p>Verify temperature, installed geometry, mechanical load, electrical requirements, process repeatability, and relevant environmental aging.</p></details>
