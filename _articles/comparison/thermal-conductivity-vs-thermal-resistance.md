<div class="quick"><strong>Quick answer</strong><p>Use conductivity for characterization and resistance or impedance for interface design.</p></div>

## Key takeaways

<div class="takeaways">

- Define the installed geometry, heat path, and acceptance limit before selecting a material.
- Compare values only when test methods and conditions are aligned.
- Validate thermal, mechanical, electrical, process, and lifetime behavior in representative hardware.

## Technical explanation

For an ideal slab, R = t/(kA). Practical TIM measurements can include bulk and contact contributions.

Thermal conductivity describes heat transport through material. The installed interface also includes geometry and contact resistance. For a simplified uniform layer, bulk resistance follows R = t/(kA), where t is thickness, k conductivity, and A area. Real assemblies require additional terms and measured validation.

## Selection parameters


| Parameter | Engineering question | Evidence to request |
|---|---|---|
| Conductivity | Which method, direction, and temperature? | Standard and specimen conditions |
| Thermal impedance | At what BLT and pressure? | Data at application conditions |
| Thickness / gap | What is the tolerance range? | Installed measurement |
| Mechanical response | What load reaches the hardware? | Compression-deflection or modulus data |
| Electrical behavior | Is isolation required? | Method, thickness, and aging context |
| Process | How is placement or dispensing controlled? | Work instruction and acceptance criteria |


Also record temperature range, surface finish, vibration or power cycling, material compatibility, inspection, rework, storage, lot control, and any applicable regulatory requirement. A supplier typical value is not a universal guarantee.

## Application example

A 6 W/m·K pad at 2 mm can have greater bulk resistance than a 3 W/m·K pad at 0.5 mm; this is an equation illustration, not product evidence.

This is an engineering illustration, not a claimed customer case. Final limits depend on the design, material formulation, and stated test conditions.

## Common mistakes

Ranking only by W/m·K; mixing data from different methods; ignoring tolerance and pressure; treating a typical value as a guaranteed design limit; skipping application-level aging.

## FAQ

<details><summary>Is conductivity enough for selection?</summary><p>No. Installed thickness, contact, pressure, geometry, electrical needs, processing, and aging must be evaluated.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can two datasheets be compared directly?</summary><p>Only when methods, units, specimen conditions, and definitions align. Otherwise use controlled side-by-side testing.</p></details>
<details><summary>What belongs in final validation?</summary><p>Verify temperature, installed geometry, mechanical load, electrical requirements, process repeatability, and relevant environmental aging.</p></details>
